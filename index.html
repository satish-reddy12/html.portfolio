          The proposed system is a Digital Signature Tool that makes signing and verifying documents secure,
          reliable, and easy. It uses cryptographic methods like RSA or ECDSA to create unique digital signatures.
          Users can sign documents with their private key, and recipients can verify them using the public key to
          confirm authenticity and ensure no changes were made. The system includes secure key management and a
          simple interface for easy use. It prevents forgery, ensures data integrity, and provides a trusted way
          to protect important documents.

          This project is about Alzheimer’s disease, a condition that affects memory and brain function.
          I created this project to spread awareness, explain its symptoms, and provide educational content
          in a simple way.
